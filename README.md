# FLAMES — Classic-styled web app

A minimal, attractive FLAMES relationship checker built with plain HTML/CSS/JS. Drop these files into a static site (or GitHub Pages) and open `index.html`.

Files:
- `index.html` — page layout and form
- `style.css` — classic/serif styling, responsive
- `script.js` — FLAMES algorithm, UI behaviors
- `favicon.svg` — simple icon

How to run:
1. Save all files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Enter two names and click "Check FLAMES".

Ideas for next steps / improvements:
- Add internationalization and support for accented letters.
- Add server-side logging / analytics (if desired).
- Provide multiple algorithm options (different ways of counting).
- Add playful animations or shareable image export of results.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for an online demo.
